# Optimization Methods

This repo contains a series of notebooks demonstrating optimization techniques using [Google OR Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/overview) optimization software.

The goal is to motivate the need for such tools and demonstrate how they operate.

I'm beginning with the Linear Programming module.

OR Tools is available in [Python](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install), [C++](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/cpp), [C#](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Google.OrTools/9.2.9972?_src=template), and [Java](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/java).
