# Optimization Methods

This repo contains a series of notebooks demonstrating optimization techniques using [Google OR Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/overview) optimization software.

The goal is to motivate the need for such tools and demonstrate how they operate.

I'm beginning with the Linear Programming module.
